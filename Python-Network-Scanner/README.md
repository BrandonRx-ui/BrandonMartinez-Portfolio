# Python Network Scanner

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Python to scan a network for active hosts and open ports. It highlights my ability to automate network discovery and document results clearly.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `socket`, `ipaddress`, `subprocess`
- VMware Workstation Player (optional VM environment)
- Sample IP ranges for testing

## Steps Taken
1. Defined IP ranges and targets for scanning.  
2. Wrote Python scripts to check host availability using `ping`.  
3. Implemented port scanning with the `socket` library.  
4. Generated reports listing active hosts and open ports.  
5. Documented workflow and captured screenshots.  

## Outcomes
- Automated network discovery process.  
- Improved ability to identify active devices and services.  
- Produced clear documentation and reusable scripts for future use.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.  
- [Scanner Running Screenshot](assets/scanner-running.png)  
- [Detected Hosts Screenshot](assets/detected-hosts.png)  
- [Port Scan Results Screenshot](assets/port-scan-results.png)  

## Artifacts
Supporting files are stored in dedicated folders:  
- [`configs`](configs/) → Sample IP ranges, scanning configuration files  
- [`scripts`](scripts/) → Python scripts for network scanning and reporting  
- [`assets`](assets/) → Screenshots of scanner execution and results
