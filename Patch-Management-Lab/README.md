# Password Reset & Account Access Workflow

## Overview
This project simulates common account access issues such as password lockouts, expired credentials, and forgotten passwords. It demonstrates my ability to securely reset accounts, verify user identity, and restore access while documenting the process clearly.

## Tools Used
- VMware Workstation Player (virtualization environment)
- Windows Server VM (Active Directory Domain Services)
- Windows 10 Evaluation VM (client machine)
- PowerShell for account management

## Steps Taken
1. Set up Active Directory with sample user accounts.  
2. Simulated account issues (lockouts, expired passwords, forgotten credentials).  
3. Verified user identity following standard help desk procedures.  
4. Reset passwords using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) and PowerShell.  
5. Documented troubleshooting workflow and captured screenshots.  

## Outcomes
- Demonstrated secure account management practices.  
- Improved ability to handle common user access issues.  
- Produced clear documentation for repeatable workflows.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.
