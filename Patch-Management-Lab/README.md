# Software Installation & Patch Management Lab

## Overview
This project simulates common software installation and patch management tasks in a store environment. It demonstrates my ability to deploy applications, apply updates, and verify system stability while documenting the process clearly.

## Tools Used
- VMware Workstation Player (virtualization environment)
- Windows 10 Evaluation VM
- Common applications (web browsers, POS updates, utilities)
- PowerShell for automation
- Windows Update and patch management tools

## Steps Taken
1. Installed baseline applications (browser, POS software, utilities).  
2. Simulated outdated versions with missing patches.  
3. Applied updates manually and through automated scripts.  
4. Verified installation success and system stability.  
5. Documented workflow and captured screenshots.  

## Outcomes
- Demonstrated ability to manage software lifecycle.  
- Improved system reliability through consistent patching.  
- Produced clear documentation for repeatable workflows.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.  
- [Outdated Software Screenshot](assets/outdated-software.png)  
- [Patch Installation Screenshot](assets/patch-installation.png)  
- [Verification Screenshot](assets/verification-success.png)  

## Artifacts
Supporting files are stored in dedicated folders:  
- [`configs`](configs/) → Installation logs, patch configuration files  
- [`scripts`](scripts/) → PowerShell/Bash scripts for automated installs and updates  
- [`assets`](assets/) → Screenshots of installation and patch lifecycle
