# Help Desk Ticketing Workflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to manage IT issues using a ticketing system. It simulates the full lifecycle of a help desk ticket: creation, categorization, prioritization, assignment, resolution, and closure. The lab highlights my ability to document issues clearly and follow structured workflows.

## Tools Used
- VMware Workstation Player (virtualization environment)
- Windows 10 Evaluation VM
- osTicket (open-source ticketing system)
- Browser (Chrome/Firefox) for ticket interface

## Steps Taken
1. Installed and configured osTicket on a VM.  
2. Created sample tickets for common IT issues (POS error, printer offline, Wi-Fi disconnect).  
3. Categorized tickets by type (hardware, software, network).  
4. Assigned priorities (low, medium, high) based on impact.  
5. Documented troubleshooting steps and resolutions inside each ticket.  
6. Closed tickets with resolution notes for future reference.  

## Outcomes
- Demonstrated structured ticket management workflow.  
- Improved ability to prioritize and track IT issues.  
- Produced clear documentation for recurring problems.  
- Showed communication and documentation skills in a help desk environment.
