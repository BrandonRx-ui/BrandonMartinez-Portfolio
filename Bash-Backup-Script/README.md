# Bash Backup Script

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Bash scripting to automate backups in a Linux environment. It highlights my ability to write scripts that copy files, compress data, and verify successful backups.

## Tools Used
- Linux VM (Ubuntu or Linux Mint)
- Bash shell
- `tar`, `gzip`, and `rsync` utilities
- Cron jobs for scheduling

## Steps Taken
1. Identified directories and files to back up (e.g., configs, logs, documents).  
2. Wrote a Bash script to copy files to a backup directory.  
3. Added compression using `tar` and `gzip`.  
4. Implemented verification by checking file integrity and timestamps.  
5. Scheduled the script with cron for automated backups.  
6. Documented workflow and captured screenshots.  

## Outcomes
- Automated backup process for critical files.  
- Reduced risk of data loss with scheduled backups.  
- Produced clear documentation and reusable scripts for future use.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.  
- [Script Execution Screenshot](assets/script-execution.png)  
- [Backup Directory Screenshot](assets/backup-directory.png)  
- [Verification Screenshot](assets/verification-success.png)  

## Artifacts
Supporting files are stored in dedicated folders:  
- [`configs`](configs/) → Backup configuration files (paths, schedules)  
- [`scripts`](scripts/) → Bash backup script(s)  
- [`assets`](assets/) → Screenshots of script execution and results
