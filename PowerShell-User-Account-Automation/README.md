# PowerShell User Account Automation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use PowerShell to automate user account management tasks. It highlights my ability to create, modify, and disable accounts efficiently while documenting the process clearly.

## Tools Used
- Windows Server VM (Active Directory Domain Services)
- Windows 10 Evaluation VM (client machine)
- PowerShell 5.1 or later

## Steps Taken
1. Set up Active Directory with sample user accounts.  
2. Wrote PowerShell scripts to automate account creation, modification, and disabling.  
3. Implemented parameters for username, password, and group membership.  
4. Tested scripts on sample accounts to verify functionality.  
5. Documented workflow and captured screenshots.  

## Outcomes
- Automated repetitive account management tasks.  
- Reduced manual errors and improved efficiency.  
- Produced clear documentation and reusable scripts for future use.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.  
- [Script Execution Screenshot](assets/script-execution.png)  
- [Account Creation Screenshot](assets/account-creation.png)  
- [Account Modification Screenshot](assets/account-modification.png)  

## Artifacts
Supporting files are stored in dedicated folders:  
- [`configs`](configs/) → Sample Active Directory or local account settings  
- [`scripts`](scripts/) → PowerShell scripts for account automation  
- [`assets`](assets/) → Screenshots of script execution and results
