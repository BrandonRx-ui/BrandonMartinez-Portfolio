# Store Network Topology Design

## Overview
This project designs a network topology for a grocery store environment. It demonstrates my ability to plan, document, and configure a small business network, including VLANs, IP addressing, and device roles.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3 (network simulation)
- VMware Workstation Player (optional VM environment)
- Cisco IOS CLI (router/switch configuration)
- Diagramming tools (draw.io, Lucidchart, or Visio)

## Steps Taken
1. Designed a logical topology including POS terminals, printers, staff PCs, and servers.  
2. Configured VLANs for separating traffic (POS, staff, guest Wi-Fi).  
3. Assigned IP addressing scheme for each subnet.  
4. Configured router and switch settings in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
5. Documented topology with diagrams and configuration files.  

## Outcomes
- Clear documentation of store network design.  
- Demonstrated ability to separate traffic for security and performance.  
- Produced repeatable configuration files for future deployments.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots and diagrams are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.

- [Switch VLAN Config Screenshot](assets/vlan-config.png)  
- [Router IP Config Screenshot](assets/router-config.png)  

## Artifacts
Supporting files are stored in dedicated folders:  
- [`configs`](configs/) → Router and switch configuration files, IP addressing plans  
- [`scripts`](scripts/) → Automation scripts for backups or diagram generation  
- [`assets`](assets/) → Screenshots and topology diagrams
