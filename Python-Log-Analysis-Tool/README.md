# Python Log Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Python to automate log analysis. It highlights my ability to parse system logs, detect errors, and generate reports that improve troubleshooting efficiency.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `re` (regex), `datetime`, `os`
- Sample system/application log files
- VMware Workstation Player (optional VM environment)

## Steps Taken
1. Collected sample log files from Windows and Linux systems.  
2. Wrote Python scripts to parse logs and extract error/warning messages.  
3. Implemented regex patterns to detect specific issues (authentication failures, network errors, application crashes).  
4. Generated summary reports with timestamps and error counts.  
5. Documented workflow and captured screenshots.  

## Outcomes
- Automated detection of recurring issues in logs.  
- Reduced troubleshooting time by highlighting critical errors.  
- Produced clear documentation and reusable scripts for future use.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.  
- [Script Running Screenshot](assets/script-running.png)  
- [Error Detection Screenshot](assets/error-detection.png)  
- [Summary Report Screenshot](assets/summary-report.png)  

## Artifacts
Supporting files are stored in dedicated folders:  
- [`configs`](configs/) → Sample log files, parsing configuration files  
- [`scripts`](scripts/) → Python scripts for log parsing and analysis  
- [`assets`](assets/) → Screenshots of script execution and results
