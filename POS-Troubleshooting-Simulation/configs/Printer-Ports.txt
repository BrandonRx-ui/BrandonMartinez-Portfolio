Printer: Receipt Printer (Simulation)
Driver: Generic/Text Only
Wrong Port: LPT1 (legacy parallel port, no device attached in VM)
Correct Port: FILE: (valid virtual output)

Notes:
- Misconfigured to LPT1 → no receipt printed because VM has no parallel hardware.
- Fixed by switching to FILE: → POS completed print job successfully.
- Demonstrates identifying a misconfiguration and applying the correct fix.
