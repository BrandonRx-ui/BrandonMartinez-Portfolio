# POS Troubleshooting Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates common point-of-sale (POS) issues in a grocery store environment, such as network drops, printer errors, and application crashes. It demonstrates my ability to diagnose and resolve problems step by step, while documenting the process clearly.

## Tools Used
- VMware Workstation Player (virtualization environment)
- Windows 10 Evaluation VM
- Unicenta POS (open-source POS application)
- Network utilities (ping, ipconfig/ifconfig, traceroute)
- osTicket (open-source ticketing system)

## Steps Taken
1. Set up a Windows VM in VMware Workstation Player.  
2. Installed Unicenta POS and configured a receipt printer.  
3. Simulated issues (network disconnect, printer misconfig, blocked app port).  
4. Ran diagnostics and applied fixes.  
5. Documented troubleshooting workflow in Markdown and osTicket.

## Outcomes
- Clear troubleshooting workflow and documentation.  
- Faster root cause identification with structured tests.  
- Repeatable steps for future incidents.  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the [`assets`](assets/) folder.  

## Artifacts
Supporting files are stored in dedicated folders:  
- [`configs`](configs/) → VMware network settings, printer configs  
- [`scripts`](scripts/) → PowerShell or Bash scripts used in troubleshooting  
- [`assets`](assets/) → Screenshots and diagrams
